### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name's Estevan Alexander, but you can call me Alexander if you like :slightly_smiling_face:. 

I'm a Computer Engineering student at University of BrasÃ­lia and I'm currently working as a web developer intern at SwitchDreams.

Here are some quick infos about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shared purchase list managing app called [Baggy](https://github.com/Baggy-App/baggy-backend "Please click me :)").
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build faster and more scalable web-apps and APIs with Ruby on Rails and Elixir's Phoenix.
- :books: I look forward to learning more about back-end and database engineering
- ðŸ“« You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-p30/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexander-p30).
- :purple_heart: Aside from programming, I love making pizza and jogging!
