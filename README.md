### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name's Estevan Alexander, but you can call me Alexander if you like :slightly_smiling_face:. 

I'm a Computer Engineering student at University of BrasÃ­lia and I'm currently working as a back-end developer at Stone.

Here are some quick infos about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shared shopping lists managing app called [Baggy](https://github.com/Baggy-App/baggy-backend "Please click me :)").
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build faster and more scalable web-apps and APIs with Elixir and Phoenix.
- :books: I look forward to learning more about back-end engineering.
- ðŸ“« You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-p30/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexander-p30).
- :purple_heart: Besides programming, I love making pizza and jogging!
